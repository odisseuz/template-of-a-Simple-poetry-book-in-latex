# Minimalist Poetry Book Template
### A simple LaTeX template for poetry collections

I originally created this template to compile a friend's poetry into a eBook. I wanted something that was easy to edit and repurpose.

Tested on Overleaf.

I am sharing this so that anyone can publish their own poetry in a minimalist design.

## Features

- A5 Format
- Minimalist Design
- Automated Table of Contents (Uploads when you write the poetry inside the code)
- Beginner Friendly — The main goal of this small project
