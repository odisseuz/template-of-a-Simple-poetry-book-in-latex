# Minimalist Poetry Book Template
# A simple LaTeX template for poetry collections

#I originally created this template to compile a friend's poetry into a eBook. I wanted something that looked like a "real book" but was easy to edit and repurpose.
#tested on Overleaf

#I am sharing thisso that anyone can publish their own poetry in a minimalist design.

#features:
--A5 Format
--Minimalist Design
--Automated Table of Contents (Uploads when you write the poetry inside the code)
--Beginner Friendly <- the main goal of this small project
